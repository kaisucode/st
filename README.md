# Kaisu's changes to Luke Smiths' build of st

## Additional features

+ Applied Cursor Blinking Patch
+ PyWal support
+ Ctrl-shift-n creates new window

Note: Am no longer using this due to being unable to incorporate **creating new window in same directory**. Will continue if a solution is found.
